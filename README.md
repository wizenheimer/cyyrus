🚧🚨 Please note that Cyyrus is currently in active development as we prepare for its public release 🚧🚨

## Why
World has plenty of data, but most of it is trapped in formats that are difficult to utilize. We’re talking about messy relational databases, unstructured text, audio, video, even the latent space of LLMs. It's not a goldmine; it's a landfill. And we're spending millions trying to clean it up.

## Introducting Cyyrus

![Cyyrus Introduction](docs/images/banner-with-plugs.png)

DataOps today looks a mix of `ClickOps`, `CryOps` and `PrayOps`. You're either clicking your life away, crying over broken pipelines, or praying your dataset doesn't implode. Fun times, right?

`Cyyrus` aims to do for datasets, what `Terraform` did for Infrastructure. It transforms unstructured data into usable datasets.

| Task | Description | Status | Future Work |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Parsing | Parse unstructured data sources (PDF, images) | Beta | Add support for more document types, audio, and video |
| Generation | Generate data using Language Models | Added OpenAI integration | Implement deterministic and rule-based generators |
| Extraction | Seed data from existing datasets (CSV, JSON, etc.) | In development | Coming Soon |
| Scraping | Collect and seed data from web sources | In development | Coming Soon |
| Labelling | Enrich image datasets for detection, classification, and segmentation | To Be Determined | Coming Soon |

Cyyrus does't make assumptions about your data because it doesn't have to. It handles it all. You can create datasets by composing these tasks into one another, enabling declarative dataset generation pipelines. Think of them like `Lego` bricks.

Sure but doesn't X do this already? Yeah, maybe. The market is saturated with products like these but these tools don't solve data silos; they create new ones.

Cyyrus doesn't bundle an analytics product, it plans to charge for transformations and checkpoints, not data storage so it benefits with data movement. Put simply, the more your data moves, the happier we are. Not the other way round.

We've put together a neat documentation. Check them [out](https://cyyrus.com/introduction) (Shoutout to our hyper-cafinated devs prompting cursor day in and out :D).

## Quick Start

We built Cyyrus so that it doesn’t need a manual to operate, but here’s one anyway. Let's get you upto speed. You'd be a pro in no time.

### Installation

Alright, baby steps. Install Cyyrus with `pip`:

```bash
pip install cyyrus
```

### Configuration

With Cyyrus, you can configure your schema using a simple YAML file. This YAML defines the structure, properties, and types of the dataset. Think of it as poor man's HCL.

1. **Define Your Tasks**: First step is to define the tasks that will be used in the dataset generation process. These tasks can include parsing, extraction, or something else.
    ```yaml
    tasks:
        # Define the invoice parsing task
        invoice_parsing:
            task_type: parsing
            task_properties:
                directory: experimental/sample
                file_type: pdf
                max_depth: 5
                parsed_format: base64

        # Define the customer info extraction task
        extract_customer_info:
            task_type: generation
            task_properties:
                model: gpt-4o-mini
                prompt: Extract customer info from the given invoice
                response_format: customer_info
                api_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY

    ```
2. **Define Your Types**: Once the tasks are defined, the next step is to define the types that will be used in the dataset. These types can include objects, arrays, or any other data type.
    ```yaml
    types:
        customer_info:
            type: object
            properties:
                customer_name:
                    type: string  # What do we call this hooman?
                customer_address:
                    type: string  # Where do we find them?
                invoice_id:
                    type: string  # The unique identifier for their financial pain
                total_amount:
                    type: float   # How much do they owe us for our digital crack?

    ```
3. **Define Your Columns**: Columns are the attributes of the dataset.
    ```yaml
    columns:
        # Define the parsed invoice column
        parsed_invoice:
            task_id: invoice_parsing # Associate a task_id with the column

        # Define the customer info column
        customer_info:
            task_id: extract_customer_info
            task_input: [parsed_invoice]
            # Define the input for the task.

        # Define the invoice items column
        invoice_items:
            task_id: extract_invoice_items
            task_input: [parsed_invoice]

        # Define the invoice qna column
        invoice_qna:
            task_id: create_invoice_qna
            task_input: [invoice_items, customer_info]
            # Ensures the task is executed after the task_input is available
    ```
4. **Define Your Datasets**: Datasets are defined by the metadata, splits, attributes, and shuffle properties.
    ```yaml
        # Define the properties of the dataset
    dataset:
        # Define the metadata of the dataset
        metadata:
            name: Invoice Dataset
            description: Dataset containing the invoice data
            tags: [invoice, financial, document]
            license: CC-BY-NC-SA
            languages: [en]

        # Define how to shuffle the dataset
        shuffle:
            seed: 42

        # Define the splits of the dataset
        splits:
            train: 0.8
            test: 0.2
            seed: 42

        # Define the attributes of the dataset
        attributes:
            required_columns: [invoice_items, customer_info]
            unique_columns: []
            flatten_columns: [invoice_items, invoice_qna]
            exclude_columns: [parsed_invoice]
            nulls: include
    ```

### Generation
Now comes the exciting part. With our schema in place, we’re ready to generate data.

```bash
cyrus run --schema-path path/to/your/schema.yaml --env-path path/to/your/.env
```

![alt text](docs/images/cli-vsc.png)

Cyrus processes each column defined in your schema, handling dependencies, types, error cases, and one-to-many mappings. You’ll see progress bars and logs for each step:

```
2024-08-26 16:01:14,096 - cyrus.composer.core - INFO - Preparing column: parsed_invoice
2024-08-26 16:01:14,097 - cyrus.composer.core - INFO - Executing task: TaskType.PARSING

## Documentation

We've put together a neat documentation. Check out [docs](https://cyyrus.com/introduction).

## Feedback

We're here to give developers what they really need, not what looks good in a TechCrunch headline. We've been there. We've felt the pain, and yes, we've even built some of those well-intentioned but ultimately inadequate tools ourselves. Now, we're channeling that into building Cyyrus.

The current Cyyrus package is experimental and built over the weekend to understand if terraforming data ops is viable. Does our approach resonate with you? ? Or do you think we're completely off base?

Don't hold back - we love to talk, and more importantly, we love to listen. [Lessgo](mailto:cyyruslabs@gmail.com).

## Adjacent Work

Current tooling around running evaluation, performing finetuning are broken. They are built by optimists, dreamers, and in many cases, brilliant engineers. But they're building tools for a world that doesn't exist - a world where data comes pre-cleaned, perfectly labeled, and ready for AI consumption.

Data is unstructured and messy. These $10/month tools? They're useless for 80% of your data. Sure, the tool costs $10/month. But what about the army of data scientist you need to make your data "tool-ready”.

Cyyrus plans to introduce components which makes existing tools "data-ready". Think `react.email` for last mile data transformation.

## Credits

Created by engineers who have an irrational belief that data transformation doesn't need to be a clusterfuck as it is today.

Terraform made infrastructure sexy. They believe a tool like Cyyrus can make data transformation sexy as well. With their half built, barely functional MVP, they're curious if they can make others believe as well.
