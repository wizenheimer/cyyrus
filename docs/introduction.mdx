## Why

World has plenty of data, but most of it is trapped in formats that are difficult to utilize. We're talking about messy relational databases, unstructured text, audio, video, and even tapping the latent space of your Large Language Models. It's not a goldmine; it's a landfill. And we're spending millions trying to clean it up.

## What

DataOps today looks a mix of ClickOps, CryOps and PrayOps. What if it didn't had to? Cyyrus aims to do for datasets, what Terraform did for infrastructure.

## How

Cyyrus makes last mile data transformation YAML configurable. It doesn't make assumptions about your data because it doesn't have to. It handles it all, in all its messy, unstructured glory.

Additionally, cyyrus plans to introduce components which makes existing tools "data-ready". Think `react.email` for last mile data transformation.

## Getting Started

We're here to give developers what they really need, not what looks good in a TechCrunch headline.

## Developer Notes

The current package is experimental and built over the weekend to understand if terraforming data ops is viable.

Does our approach resonate with you? Or do you think we're completely off base? Don't hold back - we love to talk, and more importantly, we love to listen. [:D](mailto:cyyruslabs@gmail.com).
