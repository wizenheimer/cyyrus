## Improving the docs

## Implementing new Tasks

Wanna see a new Task? We're all ears! We love expanding Cyyrus to cover as many use cases as possible. We suggest to open an issue for discussion first to make sure your idea is aligned with the project goals.

## Opening issues

Open an issue to report bugs or to propose new features.

- Spotted a Bug? Awesome. Tell us all about it! What happened? What did you expect to happen? Include as many details as you can, like your browser version, OS, and any other software versions that might be relevant. If you can, include a code snippet or a screenshot to help us understand the issue better.

- Got a Feature Idea? Awesome! Tell us all about it! Paint us a picture, why it's useful, and how you think it should work. The more info you give us, the easier it'll be to discuss and implement your amazing suggestion.

## Submitting pull requests

We absolutely love pull requests! Got a massive, world-changing idea? Awesome! But hey, let's chat about it first - drop us an issue and we'll geek out together!

- **Forking the repository**: clone it locally and create a branch for your proposed bug fix or new feature. Avoid working directly on the master branch.

- **Making changes**: implement your bug fix or feature, write tests to cover it and make sure all tests are passing. Then commit your changes, push your bug fix/feature branch to the origin (your forked repo) and open a pull request to the upstream (the repository you originally forked)'s main branch.

Got questions? Stuck on something? Don't sweat it! Reach out to our maintainers. We're here to help you shine!
