Task IDs serve as unique identifiers for tasks, allowing you to reference and manage them across your pipeline.

1. Each task ID must be `unique`. Because why have two tasks with the same ID?
2. Task IDs are `case-sensitive`. This means that `ProcessInvoice` and `processinvoice` are treated as two distinct identifiers.
3. Task IDs act as `references` for the system to correctly identify and execute specific tasks. They are used in task inputs, dependency management, and workflow orchestration.

To keep things manageable, here's a quick tip: use descriptive and meaningful task IDs. This practice will help you quickly identify tasks and understand their purpose within your pipeline.

1. **Uniqueness**: Ensure each task ID is unique to prevent conflicts and ambiguity.
2. **Descriptiveness**: Choose IDs that clearly describe the task's function. This aids in understanding the workflow at a glance.
3. **Consistency**: Adopt a consistent naming convention across your workflow. This could involve using camel case, snake case, or something else.
4. **Case Sensitivity Awareness**: Be mindful of case sensitivity when referencing task IDs throughout your workflow configuration.
5. **Avoid Generic Names**: Steer clear of overly generic names like "task_1" or "process_data". Opt for more specific identifiers that indicate the task's purpose.
