Arrays are how you represent hordes of data. A list of products? Array. A catalog of customers? Array. The entire order history of your galactic empire? You bet, that's an array.

<CodeGroup>
```YAML Array Type
invoice_qna:
    type: array
    items:
      type: object
      properties:
        question:
          type: string  # The burning questions about their invoice
        answer:
          type: string  # Our attempts to explain why they owe us money
```
</CodeGroup>

Arrays are used to define a list of items of a specific type. Each item in the array must be of the same type.

Arrays are used to represent collections of items, such as a list of products, a list of customers, or a list of orders.

Array types must have an `items` property. The `items` property defines the type of the items in the array. The `items` property can be any type, including primitive types, object types, or other array types.
