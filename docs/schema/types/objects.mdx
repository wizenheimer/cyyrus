Objects are the Swiss Army knives of the type world. They're the ultimate flex, letting you create your own data structures. Each key is a string, and each value can be any damn type you want. Objects are how you define complex data structures, like entities in your domain model.

They're the entities, the things, the stuff that populates your data universe. Want to create a digital human? Object. A virtual planet? Object. A simulated economy? You guessed it, object.

```YAML Object Type
customer_info:
    type: object
    properties:
      customer_name:
        type: string  # What do we call this meat popsicle?
      customer_address:
        type: string  # Where do they park their meat vehicle?
      invoice_id:
        type: string  # The unique identifier for their financial pain
      total_amount:
        type: float   # How much do they owe us for our digital crack?

Objects are the most versatile type in the schema. They are used to define a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is a string, and each value can be any type.

Objects are used to define complex data structures and are often used to represent entities in the domain model.

Object types must have a `properties` property set to `object`. The `properties` object contains the key-value pairs that define the object's structure.
