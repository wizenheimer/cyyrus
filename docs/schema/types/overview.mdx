## What are Types?

Types are like blueprints for your data. They define the structure of your data and how it can be interacted with.

Types are used to define the shape of the data that will be generated. They define the properties of the data, such as the data type, format, and constraints.

Once outlined they tell Cyyrus, "Hey, this chunk of info is a string of text" or "This bit here? It's a number." and so on. Without types, your data would be a mess of random bits.

```YAML Primitive Types
types:
    question:
        type: string  # For when you need to ask the important questions
    answer:
        type: string  # For when you think you know everything
    relevance:
        type: float   # Because sometimes, things are only kinda relevant
    count:
        type: integer  # For counting things, like how many model weights you own
    is_deleted:
        type: boolean  # Schr√∂dinger's data: deleted and not deleted at the same time
```
```YAML Object Type
customer_info:
    type: object
    properties:
      customer_name:
        type: string  # What do we call this meat popsicle?
      customer_address:
        type: string  # Where do they park their meat vehicle?
      invoice_id:
        type: string  # The unique identifier for their financial pain
      total_amount:
        type: float   # How much do they owe us for our digital crack?
```
```YAML Array Type
invoice_qna:
    type: array
    items:
      type: object
      properties:
        question:
          type: string  # The burning questions about their invoice
        answer:
          type: string  # Our attempts to explain why they owe us money
